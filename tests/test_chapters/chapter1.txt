Changing 
Software

Changing Software

Changing code is great. It’s what we do for a living. But there are ways of
changing code that make life difﬁcult, and there are ways that make it much
easier. In the industry, we haven’t spoken about that much. The closest we’ve
gotten is the literature on refactoring. I think we can broaden the discussion a
bit and talk about how to deal with code in the thorniest of situations. To do
that, we have to dig deeper into the mechanics of change.

Four Reasons to Change Software

For simplicity’s sake, let’s look at four primary reasons to change software. 

1. Adding a feature

2. Fixing a bug

3. Improving the design

4. Optimizing resource usage

Adding Features and Fixing Bugs

Adding a feature seems like the most straightforward type of change to make.
The software behaves one way, and users say that the system needs to do some-
thing else also. 

Suppose  that  we  are  working  on  a  web-based  application,  and  a  manager
tells us that she wants the company logo moved from the left side of a page to
the right side. We talk to her about it and discover it isn’t quite so simple. She
wants to move the logo, but she wants other changes, too. She’d like to make it
animated for the next release. Is this ﬁxing a bug or adding a new feature? It
depends on your point of view. From the point of view of the customer, she is
deﬁnitely asking us to ﬁx a problem. Maybe she saw the site and attended a

meeting  with  people  in  her  department,  and  they  decided  to  change  the  logo
placement  and  ask  for  a  bit  more  functionality.  From  a  developer’s  point  of
view,  the  change  could  be  seen  as  a  completely  new  feature.  “If  they  just
stopped changing their minds, we’d be done by now.” But in some organiza-
tions the logo move is seen as just a bug ﬁx, regardless of the fact that the team
is going to have to do a lot of fresh work.

It is tempting to say that all of this is just subjective. You see it as a bug ﬁx,
and I see it as a feature, and that’s the end of it. Sadly, though, in many organi-
zations, bug ﬁxes and features have to be tracked and accounted for separately
because of contracts or quality initiatives. At the people level, we can go back
and forth endlessly about whether we are adding features or ﬁxing bugs, but it
is all just changing code and other artifacts. Unfortunately, this talk about bug-
ﬁxing and feature addition masks something that is much more important to us
technically:  behavioral  change.  There  is  a  big  difference  between  adding  new
behavior and changing old behavior. 

Behavior  is  the  most  important  thing  about  software.  It  is  what  users  depend  on.
Users like it when we add behavior (provided it is what they really wanted), but if we
change or remove behavior they depend on (introduce bugs), they stop trusting us.

In  the  company  logo  example,  are  we  adding  behavior?  Yes.  After  the
change, the system will display a logo on the right side of the page. Are we get-
ting rid of any behavior? Yes, there won’t be a logo on the left side.

Let’s look at a harder case. Suppose that a customer wants to add a logo to
the right side of a page, but there wasn’t one on the left side to start with. Yes,
we are adding behavior, but are we removing any? Was anything rendered in
the place where the logo is about to be rendered? 
Are we changing behavior, adding it, or both?
It turns out that, for us, we can draw a distinction that is more useful to us as
programmers. If we have to modify code (and HTML kind of counts as code),
we could be changing behavior. If we are only adding code and calling it, we are
often adding behavior. Let’s look at another example. Here is a method on a
Java class:

public class CDPlayer
{
    public void addTrackListing(Track track) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}

The  class  has  a  method  that  enables  us  to  add  track  listings.  Let’s  add

another method that lets us replace track listings.

public class CDPlayer
{
    public void addTrackListing(Track track) {
        ...
    }

    public void replaceTrackListing(String name, Track track) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}

When we added that method, did we add new behavior to our application or
change  it?  The  answer  is:  neither.  Adding  a  method  doesn’t  change  behavior
unless the method is called somehow.

Let’s make another code change. Let’s put a new button on the user interface
for the CD player. The button lets users replace track listings. With that move,
we’re adding the behavior we speciﬁed in replaceTrackListing method, but we’re
also subtly changing behavior. The UI will render differently with that new but-
ton.  Chances  are,  the  UI  will  take  about  a  microsecond  longer  to  display.  It
seems nearly impossible to add behavior without changing it to some degree. 

Improving Design

Design improvement is a different kind of software change. When we want to
alter software’s structure to make it more maintainable, generally we want to
keep its behavior intact also. When we drop behavior in that process, we often
call that a bug. One of the main reasons why many programmers don’t attempt
to improve design often is because it is relatively easy to lose behavior or create
bad behavior in the process of doing it.

The act of improving design without changing its behavior is called refactor-
ing. The idea behind refactoring is that we can make software more maintain-
able  without  changing  behavior  if  we  write  tests  to  make  sure  that  existing
behavior doesn’t change and take small steps to verify that all along the pro-
cess. People have been cleaning up code in systems for years, but only in the last
few years has refactoring taken off. Refactoring differs from general cleanup in
that we aren’t just doing low-risk things such as reformatting source code, or
invasive and risky things such as rewriting chunks of it. Instead, we are making
a series of small structural modiﬁcations, supported by tests to make the code
easier to change. The key thing about refactoring from a change point of view is
that  there  aren’t  supposed  to  be  any  functional  changes  when  you  refactor
(although behavior can change somewhat because the structural changes that
you make can alter performance, for better or worse).

Optimization

Optimization is like refactoring, but when we do it, we have a different goal.
With both refactoring and optimization, we say, “We’re going to keep function-
ality  exactly  the  same  when  we  make  changes,  but  we  are  going  to  change
something else.” In refactoring, the “something else” is program structure; we
want  to  make  it  easier  to  maintain.  In  optimization,  the  “something  else”  is
some resource used by the program, usually time or memory.

Putting It All Together

It  might  seem  strange  that  refactoring  and  optimization  are  kind  of  similar.
They seem much closer to each other than adding features or ﬁxing bugs. But is
this really true? The thing that is common between refactoring and optimiza-
tion is that we hold functionality invariant while we let something else change. 
In general, three different things can change when we do work in a system:

structure, functionality, and resource usage.

Let’s  look  at  what  usually  changes  and  what  stays  more  or  less  the  same
when we make four different kinds of changes (yes, often all three change, but
let’s look at what is typical):

Superﬁcially,  refactoring  and  optimization  do  look  very  similar.  They  hold
functionality invariant. But what happens when we account for new functional-
ity separately? When we add a feature often we are adding new functionality,
but without changing existing functionality.

Adding features, refactoring, and optimizing all hold existing functionality
invariant. In fact, if we scrutinize bug ﬁxing, yes, it does change functionality,
but the changes are often very small compared to the amount of existing func-
tionality that is not altered. 

Feature addition and bug ﬁxing are very much like refactoring and optimiza-
tion. In all four cases, we want to change some functionality, some behavior,
but we want to preserve much more (see Figure 1.1). 

Risky Change

Existing Behavior

New Behavior

Figure 1.1  Preserving behavior.

That’s a nice view of what is supposed to happen when we make changes,
but what does it mean for us practically? On the positive side, it seems to tell us
what we have to concentrate on. We have to make sure that the small number
of things that we change are changed correctly. On the negative side, well, that
isn’t the only thing we have to concentrate on. We have to ﬁgure out how to
preserve  the  rest  of  the  behavior.  Unfortunately,  preserving  it  involves  more
than  just  leaving  the  code  alone.  We  have  to  know  that  the  behavior  isn’t
changing, and that can be tough. The amount of behavior that we have to pre-
serve is usually very large, but that isn’t the big deal. The big deal is that we
often  don’t  know  how  much  of  that  behavior  is  at  risk  when  we  make  our
changes. If we knew, we could concentrate on that behavior and not care about
the rest. Understanding is the key thing that we need to make changes safely.

Preserving existing behavior is one of the largest challenges in software development.
Even  when  we  are  changing  primary  features,  we  often  have  very  large  areas  of
behavior that we have to preserve.

Risky Change

Preserving behavior is a large challenge. When we need to make changes and
preserve behavior, it can involve considerable risk.

CHANGING SOFTWARE

Risky Change

To mitigate risk, we have to ask three questions:

1. What changes do we have to make?

2. How will we know that we’ve done them correctly?

3. How will we know that we haven’t broken anything?

How much change can you afford if changes are risky?
Most teams that I’ve worked with have tried to manage risk in a very conser-
vative way. They minimize the number of changes that they make to the code
base. Sometimes this is a team policy: “If it’s not broke, don’t ﬁx it.” At other
times, it isn’t anything that anyone articulates. The developers are just very cau-
tious when they make changes. “What? Create another method for that? No,
I’ll just put the lines of code right here in the method, where I can see them and
the rest of the code. It involves less editing, and it’s safer.” 

It’s tempting to think that we can minimize software problems by avoiding
them, but, unfortunately, it always catches up with us. When we avoid creating
new classes and methods, the existing ones grow larger and harder to under-
stand. When you make changes in any large system, you can expect to take a
little time to get familiar with the area you are working with. The difference
between good systems and bad ones is that, in the good ones, you feel pretty
calm after you’ve done that learning, and you are conﬁdent in the change you
are about to make. In poorly structured code, the move from ﬁguring things out
to making changes feels like jumping off a cliff to avoid a tiger. You hesitate and
hesitate. “Am I ready to do it? Well, I guess I have to.” 

Avoiding  change  has  other  bad  consequences.  When  people  don’t  make
changes often they get rusty at it. Breaking down a big class into pieces can be
pretty involved work unless you do it a couple of times a week. When you do, it
becomes routine. You get better at ﬁguring out what can break and what can’t,
and it is much easier to do. 

The last consequence of avoiding change is fear. Unfortunately, many teams
live with incredible fear of change and it gets worse every day. Often they aren’t
aware of how much fear they have until they learn better techniques and the
fear starts to fade away. 

We’ve  talked  about  how  avoiding  change  is  a  bad  thing,  but  what  is  our
alternative? One alternative is to just try harder. Maybe we can hire more peo-
ple so that there is enough time for everyone to sit and analyze, to scrutinize all
of the code and make changes the “right” way. Surely more time and scrutiny
will make change safer. Or will it? After all of that scrutiny, will anyone know
that they’ve gotten it right?
